My name is Linlin. I'm currently a PhD student at Fudan University majored in [neurosciene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience). The power of brain and the extremely diverse behaviors generated by it deeply attract me. In the lab, I perform pharmacological and electrophysiological experiments with freely moving rats. Besides, I'm enthusiastic about machine learning and implementing those algrithms in [Python](https://www.python.org/) or [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/).
